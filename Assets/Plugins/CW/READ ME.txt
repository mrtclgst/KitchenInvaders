Welcome to CW assets!

Inside each asset folder is the GUIDE file (e.g. Plugins/CW/***/GUIDE), which contains the documentation.
Simply select this file in the Project tab, and from the inspector tab click the "Local Documentation" button!
You can also open the documentation by clicking the "Documentation" icon at the top right of any component inspector.

You can find all demo scenes in the Examples folder (e.g. Plugins/CW/***/Examples), which take you step by step through each feature.

Enjoy!
